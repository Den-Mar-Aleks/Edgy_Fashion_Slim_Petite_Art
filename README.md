### ComfyUI / AITS Toolkit (YAML-style)
```yaml
lora:
  name: "dmsnoa/Edgy_Fashion_Slim_Petite_Art"
  weight: 0.6
```

### Prompt Tips
Works best with prompts like:
- `full body, city street, night, wet asphalt, neon, glossy jacket, latex skirt`
- `sportswear, shiny fabric, editorial fashion, street photography`

Avoid overly tight face-only portraits if your goal is the outfit/look (this LoRA shines on full-body).

## 🔐 Safety / Intended Use
